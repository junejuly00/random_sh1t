## Color Algorithms & Theory

### Color Space Conversions
The color space conversion algorithms used in this application are based on standard mathematical formulas and are in the public domain:

- **RGB to HSV/HSL**: Standard algorithms as defined by computer graphics literature
- **Complementary Colors**: 180-degree hue rotation
- **Analogous Colors**: ¬±30¬∞ and ¬±60¬∞ hue variations  
- **Triadic Colors**: 120-degree hue intervals
- **Monochromatic**: Brightness/saturation variations

These algorithms are mathematical formulas and not subject to copyright.
